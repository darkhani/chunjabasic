안드로이드 프로젝트 내손의 서당을 공개합니다:

1. 이 코드를 사용함에 따른 모든 책임은 사용자가 집니다.
2. 맘껏 가져다 이용하세요. 가능할지 모르나 상용도 가능합니다.
3. 대한민국 학생들에 대한 프로그래밍 교육을 환영합니다.
4. 내가 프로그래밍 해봐서 아는데... 하는 갑의 횡포를 두려워 합니다.

이 프로젝트는 구글플레이-내손의서당 의 공개버젼입니다.:
* 이클립스를 이용하였습니다. 
* 뭐 혹시나 코드에서 아! 이러구나.. 라던가... 헐 이건 뭐지? 
이럼 안되겠다 같은것을 느끼셔서 도움 되셨다면,
광고 한번 눌러 주... 씁... 강제는 아닙니다. ㅋㅋ
